		"Description": "This program is a collection of all the fractals, games and other little projects that I have programmed as part of my Matura Paper.\nThe name of the paper is \"Fraktale und ihre Anwendung im Game-Design\". In it I analyze different fractals, explain how I implemented them and discuss different applications.\n\nBy selecting one of the apps on the left a quick description, the controls and some additional info about the app will be displayed. An app can be loaded by clicking the LOAD button on the bottom right of the screen.\nBy pressing R inside an app the Options menu will be opened, in which the parameters and other setting of the app can be modified. The F12 button can be used to take a screenshot. To exit the app simply press ESCAPE or click the arrow on the top left of the screen.\n\nI recommend having a decent graphics card to run this program unless you enjoy stop motion fractals.\n\nThe source code of \"Fractals\" is available on GitHub: https://github.com/AutisticSlav/Fractals.",
